We have rules over how our git commit messages must be formatted.

Commit Message Format

Each commit message consists of a header, a body and a footer.

<header>
<BLANK LINE>
<body>
<BLANK LINE>
<footer>
Any line of the commit message cannot be longer 100 characters! This allows the message to be easier to read on Github as well as in various git tools.

HEADER:

The Header contains a succinct description of the change:

use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes"
don't capitalize first letter
no dot (.) at the end
Body

If your change is simple, the Body is optional.

Just as in the Header, use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes". The Body should include the motivation for the change and contrast this with previous behavior.

FOOTER:

The footer is the place to reference GitHub issues that this commit Closes.

You must use the Ticket number from JIRA here to link it with the Atlasian for issue tracking.

EXAMPLE:

For example, here is a good commit message:

upgrade to Spring Boot 1.1.7

upgraded the Maven and Gradle builds to use the new Spring Boot 1.1.7,
